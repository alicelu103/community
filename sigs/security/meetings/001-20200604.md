## Agenda
* Discuss the adaptation scheme of differential privacy on the graph mode of mindspore
* Random Normal operator implementation
* Investigation of differential privacy algorithms based one other mechanisms such as laplace

## Conference links

* If we change the interface in the future, we should check all the projects which refer to the interface. Maybe command 'grep' is a choice to find all the interface code

## Action items
* Organize a meeting about the neural fuzzing solution
* List of supported optimizer methods
* Differential privacy performance under other networks
* Unified interface under pynative mode and graph mode
* The result of training speed and accuracy under graph mode
