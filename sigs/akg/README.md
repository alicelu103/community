# MindSpore AKG Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the AKG Special Interest Group (SIG). This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding **Normalization** , **Auto Schedule**, **Instruction Emit**, **Backend Optimization**. Feedbacks and contributions are welcomed.
1. **Normalization**: The mainly optimization of normalization includes three address transform, common subexpression elimination, copy propagation and so on.
2. **Auto Schedule**: The auto schedule module mainly have vectorization, loop tiling, mem promotion and loop distribution.
3. **Instruction Emit**: The instruction emitting module has the optimization about loop normalization, auto pragma and emit instruction.
4. **Backend Optimization**: The backend optimization module consists of double buffer optimization, storage rewrite optimization and inject sync optimization.
