# MindSpore GraphEngine Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the GraphEngine Special Interest Group (SIG). This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding **GE API** and **GE Core** in MindSpore. Feedbacks and contributions are welcomed.
1. **GE API**: Interface between GE Core and front end which controls the initialization and finalization of GE Core and Sessions.
2. **GE Core**: Acts as the core module of GE and would be responsible for graph processing operations, consisting of six parts, i.e. graph preparation, graph partition, graph optimization, graph compilation, graph loading and graph execution.
