# Topic2: Memory Optimization

## Motivation:
​There are many strategies for memory optimization, such as recalculation and host-device memory switching. These strategies further break through the memory bottleneck by increasing the amount of calculation and increase the batchsize. Increasing batchsize can often improve the utilization of GPU and NPU to improve throughput performance.

## Target:

Adaptive search memory optimization strategy to find the best balance between recalculation overhead and memory optimization benefits, so as to optimize the overall network performance.
