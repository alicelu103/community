## Slack guidelines

Slack is the main communication platform for MindSpore outside of our mailing lists. Itâ€™s important that conversation stays on topic in each channel, and that everyone abides by the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct_en.md). Community members should all expect to have a positive experience.

Chat is searchable and public. Do not make comments that you would not say on a video recording or in another public space. Please be courteous to others.

*`@here`* and *`@channel`* should be used rarely. Members will receive notifications from these commands and we are a global project - please be kind. Note: *`@all`* is only to be used by admins.

You can join the [MindSpore Slack](https://mindspore.slack.com/) instance at [https://mindspore.slack.com/](https://join.slack.com/t/mindspore/shared_invite/zt-dgk65rli-3ex4xvS4wHX7UDmsQmfu8w).
